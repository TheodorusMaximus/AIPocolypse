## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive roadmap for optimizing the AIpocolypse project, focusing on performance, UI/UX, and web design best practices. The roadmap provides a phased approach to transform the project from its current state to production readiness.

## Current State Assessment

### Code Base Inventory

The project is a React-TypeScript application built with Vite, featuring a cyberpunk aesthetic focused on digital resistance tools. The current structure includes:

1. **Frontend Architecture**:
   - React 18.3 with TypeScript
   - Vite as the build tool
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Framer Motion for animations

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Layout-based organization with separate sections (Hero, Tools, Origin, etc.)
   - Multiple component directories for different sections
   - Reusable shared components

3. **Data Management**:
   - Static data files in TypeScript
   - No apparent global state management

4. **Styling Approach**:
   - Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
   - Custom animations defined in animations.css

5. **Build & Development**:
   - Vite configuration
