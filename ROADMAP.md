# AIpocolypse Project Roadmap

## Completed

### Component Refactoring
- âœ… Created modular header components (`SectionTitle`, `JoinCTA`, `SectionDivider`)
- âœ… Developed visualization components (`BackgroundElements`, `NetworkVisualization`, `ResistanceMap`, `MapAndActivityContainer`)
- âœ… Built activity tracking components (`LiveActivityFeed`)
- âœ… Implemented statistics display (`CommunityStats`)
- âœ… Developed testimonial showcase component (`ResistanceTestimonials`)
- âœ… Created resources grid component (`ResourcesGrid`)
- âœ… Integrated all components into main `SocialRefactored` component
- âœ… Added export index file for simplified imports

### Proverbs Section Refactoring
- âœ… Created `ConnectionLines` component for visualizing principle relationships
- âœ… Developed `PrincipleCard` component for individual principles
- âœ… Built `PrincipleDetail` component for expanded information
- âœ… Refactored main `Proverbs` component to use modular components

### Testing
- âœ… Created test files for refactored components
- âœ… Implemented component-specific tests
- âœ… Added ESLint configuration for test files
- âœ… Fixed critical issues preventing builds
- âœ… Documented test coverage and approach

### Code Quality
- âœ… Fixed build-breaking errors in component exports
- âœ… Addressed unused variables in components
- âœ… Removed unused imports
- âœ… Fixed parameter issues in callback functions

## In Progress

### Code Quality Improvements
- ðŸ”¶ Address remaining ESLint warnings throughout codebase 
- ðŸ”¶ Fix type issues in test files
- ðŸ”¶ Resolve React hooks dependency warnings
- ðŸ”¶ Standardize file naming conventions (case sensitivity issues)

### Testing Enhancements
- ðŸ”¶ Improve test coverage for all components
- ðŸ”¶ Add integration tests for complete sections
- ðŸ”¶ Fix TypeScript typing for Jest matchers

## Upcoming Tasks

### Component Migration
- Complete migration from legacy components to refactored versions
- Update App.tsx to use refactored components
- Deprecate old component versions

### Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting for larger components
- Add lazy loading for sections not in initial viewport
- Optimize image and asset loading
- Analyze and improve render performance

### Accessibility Improvements
- Audit components for accessibility compliance
- Add ARIA attributes where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Implement focus management for modal components

### Additional Features
- Add dark/light theme support
- Implement responsive design improvements for smaller screens
- Add language localization support
- Create animated transitions between sections

### Documentation
- Complete JSDocs for all components
- Create Storybook stories for component visualization
- Document component props and usage patterns
- Create architecture diagram of component relationships

## Long-term Goals

### State Management
- Evaluate current state management approach
- Consider implementing context API or Redux for global state
- Optimize state updates for performance

### Build and Deployment
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Implement automated testing in CI
- Create production build optimization strategies
- Deploy to production environment

### User Experience
- Conduct usability testing
- Gather feedback on UI/UX
- Iterate on design based on user feedback
- Implement analytics to track user interactions

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Address the remaining ESLint issues in a systematic way
2. Implement the migration plan to start using refactored components
3. Enhance test coverage for critical components
4. Improve accessibility features across all components
5. Create comprehensive documentation for the refactored architecture
